# PowerBI_Dashboard_Project
Created interactive dashboard which provides valuable insight into online sales data, allowing you to make informed decisions for your business. Focusing on simplicity and usability, this dashboard also presents key visualizations of key metrics to help you understand and analyse your online sales performance.

Project Learnings:
âœ…Understanding complex parameters: Using complex parameters to drill down into the worksheet allowed me to analyse data at a granular level. This helped to identify specific trends and strategies that might otherwise have been overlooked.
âœ…Optimization using filters and slicers: Provides user-friendly experience for optimization using filters and slicers. Users could easily manipulate the data by applying various filters and slicers to focus on specific aspects of the sales profile relevant to their analysis.
âœ…Making links and merging tables: Making links and combining new tables enabled multiple data sets to be combined and the analysis extended. This combination of data from multiple sources provided a comprehensive view of online sales performance.
âœ…Data manipulation and Calculations: Calculation processing of data was essential to gain meaningful insights. Using statistics like aggregation, transformation, and comparison, I was able to create valuable metrics and indicators for analysis.
âœ…User benchmarking: The interactivity of the dashboard was enhanced by using user benchmarks to generate visualizations. And users can dynamically change parameters and visualize the impact of sales events, providing real-time insights and analytics.
âœ…Customized visualizations: Using customized graphics, such as bar charts, pie charts, scatter charts, and maps, it offered different perspectives on online sales information and any kind of visualization in its ability to convey extraordinary insight and trends.
âœ…Visualization selection based on data characteristics: The choice of visualization types depended on the nature of the data being analysed. Selecting appropriate visualizations based on the data characteristics, such as categorical or numerical, helped in effectively communicating the insights to stakeholders.

ðŸ’¥Overall, this project taught me the importance of data visualization, optimization, and applied analysis. This reinforced the importance of data manipulation, appropriate visual selection and an iterative development process to create dashboards with effective insights.
